## ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY

### Starting Up in Tier-2 Cities: The Lucknow Experience
In early 2012, while nurturing the thought of starting up, I decided to base myself out of Lucknow instead of Delhi, where I had spent almost a decade. This decision was based on three fundamental parameters:

1. **Economics:** Manpower, office, and other residual costs
2. **Core Business Nuance:** We wanted to work with Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, requiring us to live and breathe in their surroundings instead of parachuting there occasionally
3. **Business Philosophy:** Being in Delhi would have made us one of thousands of similar ventures. In a Tier-2 city, we started big from day one. Business is about perception value - people prefer dealing with reliable, established service providers, especially in the education space

**Challenges and Solutions:**

1. **Trained Manpower:** Finding the right talent in Tier-2 cities requires investing more time in people management. With an intact core team, you build loyal, lifelong organizational members - something rare in today's business environment.

2. **Investors:** While investors exist everywhere, Tier-2/3 cities may lack those familiar with terms like "valuations." This forces startups to understand how to become financially viable sooner. In cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, and Chandigarh, business is defined by profitability rather than theoretical valuations.

**Recommendations for Tier-2/3 Entrepreneurs:**
- Be prepared to work hard and get your hands dirty
- For hybrid models, develop the on-ground component first to strengthen your position when seeking investors
- Focus on creating products for non-metro cities - addressing common problems with common-sense solutions
- Recognize that many problems remain unaddressed at this level, requiring passionate entrepreneurs with a mission
